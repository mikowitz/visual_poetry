# VisualPoetry

I made a poem using Angular and Sinatra: [snow flakes](http://snow-flakes.herokuapp.com 'snow flakes')

But I more or less hand-coded the whole thing because I wasn't sure what I was
doing. But then it was done and I'd figured it out, so this is where I'm trying
to build a better tool for generating similar projects in the future.

At least, that's the plan. I'm not sure what's going to happen.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'visual_poetry'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install visual_poetry

## Usage

TBD
